    \mysection{Abstract}
    This report summarizes the findings during the development process of implementing a proof of concept for a smart
    watch application to allow the control and monitoring of the most common open source 3D printers.
    Using a proprietary IDE called Tizen studio, an application was built for the Samsung Galaxy Watch to allow simple
    control of a Prusa MK3s 3D printer.
    The goal was for the application to be able to show a live video stream of the printer,
    provide information about ongoing prints such as temperature readings, and give the user the ability to start a
    print and control the axes outside of printing operations.
    Due to unforeseen issues during the implementation process, the application was ultimately not completed within the
    project deadline, but all required features was tested and proved to be possible from the device.
    \\\\
    Throughout this project, it became clear that Tizen studio was lacking the basic development tools needed to effectively work
    with it, and was thus replaced in part by the Webstorm IDE.
    Additionally, Tizen OS made it difficult to implement accessibility features.
    Finally, it was challenging to create an application with such a small display screen while showing the relevant
    information in a good way, thus many of the features present in for example the popular 3D printer monitor software OctoPrint
    were not feasible to replicate on a smart watch.

    \mysection{Motivation}
    While operating a 3D printer there are many tasks requireing the operator to interact with the printer, but a computer is
    still required to prepare the printing jobs.
    Secondly 3D printers are computer numeric control (CNC) machines, and therefore highly unreliable to a point which 
    human monitoring is recommended by most manufacturers and resellers.
    Many different operation and monitoring services have been published, and one of the most known is Octoprint.
    Octoprint provides any operator with almost any wanted features while also being open for installing plugins, allowing the user
    to expand the usability of the appication.
    \\\\
    Unfortunately with remote accsess the printer may be placed in another location requireing any operator to travel back and forth
    between the computer and the printer.
    As a solution to this problem a mobile device can be used while at the printing site, and an even easier accessible device would 
    be a wearable (like a watch, or glasses).
    Being able to setup an monitor from a smart watch could greatly benefit an operator by the ease of access alone, and even more so
    by using physical input devices with feedback.
    \\\\
    The idea of using smart watches to control and monitor 3D printers is not new, but the Tizen web store does not
    currently hold any viable solution so the only option left was to develop a personal solution.
    Luckily since the printer was already set up with an Octoprint control server hosting the web interface, development would only
    include integration towards Octoprints application programming interface (API).
    \\\\
    Working with APIs at earlier occasions, much of the applications logic could be imported, leaving mainly the
    device limitations and design.
    Using online resources for a private project would also not require to much licensing issues, simplifying even the
    design process.
    Unfortunately due to the vast difference in both functionality and behaviour between different 3D printer
    technologies, this project will only cover the most common home/hobby technologies.
    \\\\
    This application is to be named TizenPrint, and shall become a valuable security mechanism for my personal use
    on my 3D printer.
    It is also worth noting that an experimental application named \textit{MyPay} was started before and developed
    in parallel to this application.
    Both aforementioned applications are totally independent, but do share some code and ideas.
    Therefore it is feasible to mention MyPay as well.

    \mysubsection{The technology}
    3D printing is a relative new technology which allows production of computer designed three dimensional models
    in certain materials.
    There are many different methods of 3D printing, but the far most common for home use is \textit{Fused filament
    fabrication} (FFF), or more commonly known as the trademarked term \textit{Fused deposition modeling} (FDM),
    which is the type used in this project.
    \\\\
    FDM is a method which extrudes thin strings of thermoplastic filament
    in layers as thin as 0.05mm and up to 1mm, controlled by computer numeric control (CNC) code.
    This allows the creation of models with great detail at a low cost, with the accuracy of stepper motors.
    It also allows for the reuse of commands to produce almost exact replicas of the same digital objects with
    little to no extra work.
    \\\\
    Unfortunately this 3D printing process is tedious, and can take several hours or even days.
    Since 3D printers are CNC machines, the FDM process is only a one way communication between the controller
    and the stepper motors.
    Meaning that during the process there exist little to no feedback from sensors for the result, while there are countless
    factors that play a role for the product from a single print operation.
    While printing any model, small errors that go undetected can be detrimental and require human intervention.
    Some failures can even cause harm to the machine itself, and has caused fires due to the high temperatures involved in
    the process.
    \\\\
    Luckily the technology is getting better, and more sensors are being added.
    This may include sensors for filament runout to prevent printing without filament, or collision detection which detects
    if any motor meets resistance preventing damage to itself or humans.
    Alas it is still recommended that you stand by the machine for the entirety of the print, but people still leave their
    homes with the dishwasher running.

    \mysubsection{Continuous innovation}
    Computer technology is constantly moving forward, and 3D printing is no exception.
    Updates are rolling out continuously for all the different systems, some updates even fix third
    party integration problems.
    \\\\
    What really changes 3D printer updates is the possibility of sending digital physical upgrades, which you can print
    and change yourself.
    This enables larger beta testing, cheaper and faster physical upgrading, and shorter production testing before a unit can ship.
    \\\\
    During this project the development printer has received
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2 physical updates
        \item 1 physical major version upgrade, requiring some new manufacturer parts
        \item 2 personal moDIFIcations for the project
        \item 5 software updates (and 1 personally compiled pre release to fix project issue) \mycitation{prusa:github:versions}
    \end{itemize}

    \newpage

    \mysection{Terminology}
    \mysubsection{Printer parts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Extruder: The heated part of the printer which melts the plastic and extrudes it.
        \item Heatbed/printbed: The plate on which a print begins, often heated for better adhesion.
        Also comes in different materials like glass or PEI .
        \item Einsy/motherboard: The main electrical board of the printer which everything is connected to.
        \item Filament: The name of the material used to create models, in a continuous string on a spool.
        Usually made of either plastic or nylon, the most common types are PLA, ABS, PET-G, TPU, and PA-12 which holds
        their unique properties, print settings, and prices.
        The filament is also what decides the color of the print, and color pigments might change some properties too.
        \item MMU: Multi material upgrade, expansion for the 3D printer which allows the use of multiple filaments and
        changing of color during printing.
    \end{itemize}

    \mysubsection{Technical}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mesh: A digital file format method for 3D objects.
        \item STL/OBJ: Some of the most used digital file formats for the mesh method.
        \item GCODE: The name of the instructions given to the 3D printer and comments.
        These codes refer to single operations eg. \textit{M104 S215 ; set extruder temp}.
        GCODE might also refer to a GCODE file.
        \item GCODE file: A file containing up to several hundred thousand lines of GCODE commands.
        Usually one file per print job.
        \item Slice: The operation where a digital mesh is processed to GCODE instructions that will replicate said object.
        This also handles settings like temperatures and speeds.
        \item Slicer: A program/application that does the slicing operation.
        Usually holds default settings for your printer, and some are proprietary.
    \end{itemize}

    \mysection{Technologies}
    \mysubsection{Octoprint}
    As of now, many 3D printers are open source, which allows users to create their own tools and better the control they have.
    One such tool is \textit{Octoprint}, which runs on a raspberryPi, hosting a web interface for your 3D printer.
    Being the most uses free solution to add wifi to printers, while also being actively supported by the printer software,
    Octoprint became the most logical option.
    \\\\
    The Octoprint server allows the user to read live sensor data from a web interface, connect a camera, and even add plugins
    for more advanced control.
    Allowing such an expansion can ease large manufacturing by, e.g.,
    allowing the removal of a single part that has failed without having to stop the print losing it entirely.
    \\\\
    Octoprint handles many common features required for 3D printing, and hosting them available under the same
    service.
    This includes web based automatic slicer, visualization of bed leveling, remote control of axis and temperature, and live camera streaming.
    All this works as both reliability and safety measures for a user, but 3D printing is still very complicated and requires
    training and experience for success.
    \\\\
    Octoprint has without a doubt added safety to printing, but is for now only available trough a web browser,
    with little to no support for smaller screens without plugins.
    Luckily they have a REST-API available, which allow further development.
    Already there are multiple applications made for different mobile devices, but fewer are available for the wearable market.

    \mysubsection{Rest-API}
    \mysubsubsection{The technology}
    An application programming interface is a gateway within an application designed for computer interactions.
    This allows any application to query the API and handle the answer as standardized formats.
    \\\\
    The REST or Restful definition only states that the host/server does not hold your state.
    The client therefore has to actively send all relevant information, but is in turn allowed to disseminate the entire
    application, and query only required information.
    \\\\
    Due to the stateless design there is no graph in which the application must be traversed, and even the api can call
    itself to make higher order functions.
    By design this can become an entirely new kind of application spaghetti, with too many endpoints and circular
    references.

        "It is no silver bullet, but a powerful tool."
        \begin{flushright}
            \tiny{--- Christoffer O. Hern\ae s, CDO. at Sbanken, about APIs}
        \end{flushright}
    \end{quote}

    \mysubsubsection{Exposing APIs}
    APIs can divide an application to smaller \textit{Single responsibility} endpoints, or separate
    backend from frontend.
    The most used parts of a service can often be made into APIs in order to remove code repetition within a business,
    and sometimes those APIs can be opened directly to the customers.
    This allows the users to develop any automated solution themselves, which we can see some larger businesses doing.
    \\\\
    In the fintech market we have seen several uses of APIs, especially since the PSD2 directive was added by the EU .
    A popular example is how many Norwegian banks are allowing the importing of external accounts, and the import of the
    Norwegian state student loan service \textit{L\aa nekassen} into Sbanken
    \mycitation{laanekassen:psd2:sbanken}
    \\\\
    Other (especially open source) applications can expose the entire application as an API allowing users to contribute
    with new solutions, like Octoprint allowing users to develop applications even for other devices.
    This is crucial to develop the TizenPrint application.

    \newpage

    \mysection{Planing the application and infrastructure}
    \mysubsection{The setup}
    The 3D printer only supports GCODE commands using mostly the NIST RS274NGC Interpreter.
    This requires GCODE to either be supplied trough an SD card directly in the 3D printer or by a physical connection.
    This is where Octoprint is connected.
    Octoprint is running on a RaspberryPi 3B+ using the Raspbian-Lite OS, in a custom built casing on the printer.
    This creates a small computer with a physical connection, and since Octoprint is accessible trough the web interface
    it acts like a wireless bridge.
    \mycitation{reprap:nist}
    \\\\
    Octoprint is running its own web service and allows certain operations even if the printer is turned off.
    It also hosts an Application protocol interface which allows other applications to access and use Octoprint as a
    service point connecting to the printer.

    \mysubsection{Goals of application}
    The application should first of all aim to substitute an operator in using a 3D printer, by allowing for easier
    access to an interface, quick controls and main information like temperature readings.
    Ideally it should also act as a small safety feature to keep an eye on a running printer from a distance, even though
    leaving any running CNC machine is discouraged.
    \\\\
    It is therefore essential to the minimum viable product (MVP), that the application is able to show a live
    video stream of the printer, and read the different temperatures in real time with minimal delay.
    Control of axis is also a priority, as this is an essential tool while operating the machine before and after
    print jobs.
    Lastly the application should hold an option to start prints, although neither upload nor perform a slicing
    operation as that would be illogical to do on such a small device.

    \newpage

    \mysubsection{Planned architecture}
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/TizenPrint-architecture.png}
        \caption{Planned Architecture;
        With this setup the physical printer and webcam is isolated by physical
        connections from the rest of the world.}
    \end{figure}

    Octoprint is running as a service on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ (marked red), with access to its filesystem for storage and other
    external applications like an alternative slicer.
    Parts of Octoprint needs to be exposed directly to the internet to act as a web interface, these parts are marked as
    blue.
    \\\\
    Please note that the stream is available alone.
    This is due to the usual browser implementation and makes development easier as it acts just like a still image.
    This is what allows the stream to be accessed even though the rest of the application uses the API .
    \\\\
    Handheld and wearable devices are small in physical size.
    It is therefore not feasible to support all of Octoprints features on such devices.
    This is usually not a problem because such devices would typically be used mainly for monitoring and setting up printing,
    for which the full feature set is not needed.
    Meanwhile more complicated features like the setup of models can be done by a computer, where one normally would design
    the model anyways.
    Here we can slice the model to our preferred settings, and upload the gcode to Octoprint where it will be stored on
    the Raspberry Pi filesystem.
    \\\\
    If wanted, the web interface could also be ignored and the GCODE file could be put directly on the 3D printers SD card
    manually.
    Octoprint is still able to read those files and start the printing job operation on them.
    From a handheld or wearable device the ability to start a print job is expected, as this allows a printer operator
    to use a computer away from the printer, and repeatedly start the same or a new job without having to slice again.

    \newpage

    \mysection{Development}
    \mysubsection{First looks}
    Development of the Tizen wearable watch application started by installing the Tizen studio.
    Tizen studio was not available to all operating systems even though it is built around Eclipse which is made in Java.
    Luckily there is still the ability to compile the source, and thus installing on the main development OS .
    \\\\
    The Tizen studio gives a standard "Hello World" program, which worked in the simulator, but would not deploy to the
    physical device due to certificate requirement, which was not supported in the used OS .
    \\\\
    Unfortunately the only other available development computer running Windows 10 did not have a processor which met
    the requirements to run the emulator (Hyper-V compatible), nor was it placed in an environment which allowed the physical device to connect
    to wifi, thus not being able to deploy.
    The solution for deploy meant dual booting into windows 10, and borrowing an external wifi signal in another
    location, which alone accounted for major delays.

    \mysubsection{Choosing development language}
    Tizen studio offers development as either a native application using C++/C or as a web application running HTML/CSS/JS
    locally on the device.
    To try both\; a small dice throwing application was developed, and it soon became clear that using the emulator to for
    each test took too long.
    Secondly the JavaScript language has easy to use built inn support for use of APIs, and would greatly increase the
    efficiency of testing as that could be done on the computer web browser.
    Lastly the styling of the application was much easier to change due to a CSS supporting reusable definitions called
    classes.
    \\\\
    It is now also possible to develop in .NET C\# using Xamarin in Microsoft Visual Studio.

    \mysubsection{Getting to know the tools}
    As an experiment, the simpler experimental application (MyPay) was developed in parallel.
    This application shows the balance on personal bank accounts, and was later expanded to list and pay electronic invoices.
    \\\\
    During the development of said experiment application, several issues were encountered.
    This included issues like the project settings needing to allow the use of external connections in order for the
    wearable OS to allow the application to connect.
    \\\\
    This is where the issue of secrets arose.
    Since this application was to be hosted publicly on github, hosting private addresses and connection secrets for
    the API would allow others to gain unauthorized access.
    This would allow anyone to steal secrets and take control of the Octoprint instance and the development 3D printer.
    To prevent this a file was made to hold said secrets, and excluded from git using gitignore, but with instructions in
    the project Readme.md.

    \mysubsection{Inadequacy}
    Tizen studio alone does not have many tools that assists development, and even some of the expected tools like the
    indentation tool do little to nothing.
    Therefore, since TizenPrint is written in such a widely used web languages (HTML/CSS/JS), it is possible to change
    the IDE .
    Since \textit{Jetbrains} has been the standard supplier of IDEs used in most courses, their product \textit{WebStorm} became the
    preferred tool.
    \\\\
    For fast testing and development;
    a visual result of the product being developed needs to be displayed after every change made.
    Since the TizenPrint application was written in the simple web languages it was able to run from a browser.
    The web browser \textit{Google Chrome} has build inn development tools, and was selected for this project mainly due to its
    ability to run JavaScript commands in a console and debug.
    \\\\
    While most browsers will display a square layout, the device holds a circular display.
    Even though the display is circular, the device uses the screen as square, and will place content outside the physical screen,
    not displaying anything.
    To expand the design, the background was set to a contrast color, and got a circular box over it to illustrate where
    the physical frame would be.

    \begin{figure}[h!]

        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/application-xyz-image.png}
        \caption{Screenshots of the application displayed in the \textit{Google Chrome} web browser.
        The black parts of the square will be placed outside the physical screen on the device.}
    \end{figure}

    \mysubsection{Development tools}
    During this project several different tools have been used.
    This is the complete list with a short description
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GIT: Version control tool used to track any changes in any documentation or source code created
        \item Github: Version control provider needed to use GIT, which also holds extra tools for development and issue tracking.
        As a bonus this is also where both Octoprint and Prusa Firmware is hosted.
        \item Intellij WebStorm: An IDE for web development, also supports LaTeX with plugins.
        Main development studio due to all the tools it provides.
        \item Tizen IDE: The main development studio has to be used for certificate management, emulator, and device management.
        \item Google Chrome: The main browser used for development.
        \item Arduino build tools: Used to compile the firmware for the 3D printer
        \item Windows 10: Main development OS
        \item Arch Linux: Secondary linux distro development, test and deploy OS
        \item Raspbian: Light linux distro OS needed to host Octoprint and control the printer.
        \item Octoprint: A web service to control open source 3D printers with a web interface.
        Also holds the API and is the tool which will be developed towards.
    \end{itemize}

    \newpage

    \mysection{Design}
    \mysubsection{Circular display}
    Working with a circular display is a rather interesting concept.
    Due to the bevels not following a straight line, while the screen effectively is outside the frame, it does mess with
    the design and layout languages CSS and HTML .
    Tizen studio does provide a small package called the Circular-helper.js which is meant to support developers by
    keeping elements inside the frame on the device.
    Still it is often easier to just use strict design and pixel measures.
    Such design is usually not viable in normal web design due to all the different devices that can access a site, but
    due to the application only supporting one device that is not an issue.
    \\\\
    Another aspect of the circular design is that it allows for some innovative figures and designs.
    Even though such a circular construction limits an already small screen, it allows the design to break certain standards,
    and move objects closer to the center of the screen.
    This forces the look to become less structured, and applies a more natural feel to almost any design,
    while only displaying the most relevant information.
    \mycitation{samsung:developer:galaxy-watch:DesignPrinciples}
    \\\\
    The circular bevels therefore promote the use of rounded scrollbars, single displayed items, and even bent text along
    the edges of the device.

    \mysubsection{One page application}
    The setup of Tizen web applications does not support more than one page.
    Unlike normal browser design where you link to different files on the server, Tizen only loads the first page, and
    refuses to handle anchors (links) as expected.
    Instead Tizen uses a provided JavaScript to display different pages.
    This is essentially done by adding and removing a style class, where only the container with the class "ui-page-active"
    is displayed, together with a possible footer which is always displayed.
    \\\\
    One page application files tend to get rather large, and can slow down development.
    Sometimes trickery can be used to load other files by Iframes and so on, but this often does not have the intended effect.
    It therefore becomes essential to move all possible aspects outside of the HTML, like scripts and SVGs in their own
    files.

    \mysubsection{Attention span}
    Wearable devices like watches are made to only be glanced at, usually while moving.
    Most applications are therefore designed only to show the most relevant information to a user.
    It is therefore important to have the app show the relevant information fast, with few interactions.
    For even a bit more complex interactions a larger device would be a more appealing choice.
    A simple interface is therefore crucial for the printer control applications.

    \mysubsection{Small display}
    The Samsung Galaxy watch has a display with high resolution, but in design it holds effectively 360 x 360 pixels,
    which is really small, only about a fifth of a normal computer screen.
    This limits the size of any text being displayed, and requires a lot of innovative design.
    \\\\
    One solution to this has been the usage of icons instead of text.
    This allows a much more efficient design for menus or footers, leaving a lot more space for the main content on the
    page.
    \\\\
    Another solution is to implement popper usage of the physical input from the device.
    The physical device does have 2 buttons, and a rotating bevel, though only one of the buttons allows
    for change.
    This adds easier to reach tactile buttons with a response to the user, but testing of these inputs does require an
    emulator, which slows down development.
    Also, the expected functionality of the physical inputs needs to be apprised for the user.

    \mysubsection{The problem of icons}
    Regrettably icons is not a fix all solution for small displays, and does come at its own cost.
    Even though most feel like icons does help with explaining the expected behaviour or meaning, they should only be used
    to assist the explanation with a text.
    This is due to the many icons being used not necessarily being standardised, or the illustrated object unknown to a
    potential user.
    \\\\
    A great example of icons not being recognised is the usage of the save icon.
    The icon usually represents an old floppy disk, which newer generations might never have experienced.
    This in turn makes the icon something we have to learn to recognise, and once learned it greatly increases the time
    it takes to find it, or associate the functionality of an interface.
    \\\\
    An argument of statistics therefore goes against the practice of icons, as they might be misinterpreted.
    If each icon holds a probability for misunderstanding, then each icon added will greatly increase the chance
    for at least one icon being misunderstood for each user.

    \mysubsection{Wearable device}
    As the intended device is a wearable watch, it is expected to be small in size.
    This physical limitation does also limit the size of internal components greatly, and then heat dissipation even more.
    Such devices can therefore not hold powerful components, nor large batteries.
    Many other devices (e.g., the apple watch), limits the thread requirements of their applications to prevent bad
    development to impact the battery life of their device.
    \\\\
    Tizen OS does not set any such visible limits, and it is therefore recommended to limit background processes, and hard
    operations.
    In the development of this app this was discovered when a stream was added.
    Due to the single page design of the application the stream was updated continuously, as long as the app was open,
    even if it was only showing temperatures.
    This lead to major decrease in battery levels after only a few minutes of testing.
    \\\\
    The solution to both aforementioned usage problems was simply to load/unload the stream, loading it only when it was
    required.

    \mysubsubsection{Legal requirements}
    Another major issue unveiled during development is the lack of integrated accessibility features.
    In Norway developers are strongly regulated by the EU and Norwegian laws, requiring developers to implement accessibility
    features to their applications.
    This includes (but is not limited to) things like, blind users, deaf users, or users otherwise unable to use the
    provided interface like amputees.
    \\\\
    This project will not focus too much on accessibility, as it is not meant to be published nor profitable.
    Nevertheless it is important to mention the severity of the inadequacy for accessibility features in the Tizen OS,
    and some of what would have to be done in the case of publishing and profiting.

    \mysubsubsection{DIFI standards}
    DIFI, the Norwegian Agency for Public Management and eGovernment, handles issues related to human prosperity
    in the digital world.
    \mycitation{difi:about}
    \\\\
    What is relevant here is the sub part for accessibility, which DIFI has an entire sub domain for.
    This includes requirements like minimum icon or text size, requirements for the readability
    of the fonts, help for screen readers and much more.
    \mycitation{difi:uu}
    \\\\
    Now Tizen OS does offer a lot of built inn accessibility features, but is overly complicated to implement into a new
    application.
    The consequence of this is that few available applications implements screen readers, and can not be used with a screen reader.
    This is especially problematic, as screen readers can usually manage to browse most features and web pages even though it is not
    implemented directly.
